# Classic ToDo application

In the application, you can add multiple task lists and edit tasks in them.

The application uses a json server as a backend.
Therefore, before starting the application, you need to start the server using the command: 
<i>npx json-server -H localhost -p 3010 -w ./db.json</i>
