In this exercise I practiced promises.<br/>
In index.js the user is asked for the path to the json file, and then the value of the "name" property is printed to the console.<br/>
There are three checks in the program:<br/>
<ul>
  <li> What if text file does not exist?</li>
  <li> What if text file does not contain json information?</li>
  <li> What if text file contains json information, but does not contain name property?</li>
</ul>
