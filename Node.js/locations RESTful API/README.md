This is a practical Restful API that uses MySQL database. <br />
The database consists of location data (latitude and longitude).

The API contains functions such as:
<ul>
<li>Find all locations from the database,
</li>
<li>Delete a location using a id,</li>
<li>Find a location by id,</li>
<li>Save a new location,</li>
<li>Possibility to filter results (max or min value of latitude of longitude),</li>
<li>Possibility to sort results according to latitude/longitude.  </li>
</ul>

Also a simple user interface has been added to the application.
It shows a map with marked locations from the database.
Double click on the map adds the click coordinate to the database.
